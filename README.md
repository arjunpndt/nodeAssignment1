# Node.js

### Node.js is a open-source, cross-platform javascript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. With the help of Node.js developers can use JavaScript for client-side and server-side code without any additional language. The Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating new thread on every request. When Node.js performs an I/O operations, instead of blocking the thread Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.

## Features of Node.js

1. **Non-blocking I/O Model** - It means it can handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking the main thread.
2. **Event-Driven** - This makes it highly scalable and efficient, especially for real-time applications and handling a large number of concurrent requests.
3. **Easy to Learn** - Instead of learning a new language for server-side development, Node.js lets you use the same JavaScript you already know for both front-end and back-end development.
4. **Fast Data Streaming** - Non-blocking I/O enables fast data streaming in Node.js. Instead of buffering large chunks of data before processing, Node.js streams data in small chunks, minimizing memory usage and processing time
5. **Scalable** - Node.js can handle a high volume of concurrent requests efficiently due to its non-blocking nature and event-driven architecture. This makes it highly scalable for web applications, APIs, and other services that deal with large amounts of traffic.
